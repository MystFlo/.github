## MystFlo

**On-demand virtual assistants for solo founders.**

Run your business like a 10-person team — without hiring one.

---

### The Problem

Solo founders spend hours on repetitive operational tasks — sending follow-ups, syncing data, managing bookings, chasing invoices. Hiring a VA costs $500-2,000/month. Building automations yourself takes weeks.

### The Solution

MystFlo gives you pre-built virtual assistants that handle it for you. No code. No hiring. Just results.

### How It Works

```
Browse  →  Connect  →  Activate  →  Monitor
```

**1. Explore** — Browse assistants by what they do for your business: boost revenue, save time, grow your audience.

**2. Connect** — Link your apps once — WhatsApp, Stripe, Google, Slack, and more. Your credentials stay encrypted, always under your control.

**3. Activate** — Preview with a free test run. See exactly what happens before going live.

**4. Pulse** — Your control room. Monitor runs, success rates, and spend in real-time.
